These scripts are I wrote for generating the PMU data under different topologies.

Some original scripts are wrote for generating 9 topologies, however, there is one topology too close to another one, so I suggest delete that one, and keep 8 topologies left for testing purpose. The detail explainsion file see "analysis.pdf" on the preface page.
